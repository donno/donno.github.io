Closing out the year 2025. An overview on some things I did, played and watched
this year.

# Things I did for 2025

* Took a deep dive into Linux images and containers.
* Posted about the name generation and date of birth that I said I would do at
  the end  of 2023. The downside is I never got around to working more on that
  project after the posts.
* Took a deep dive into Anime for about three months.
* Sat the exam for "AWS Certified Developer - Associate".
  * Given my employer doesn't contract its developers out it wasn't worth the
    hassle of preparing for the exam or taking it.
## Games
Towards the end of the year I stopped my Xbox Live Gold subscription after
about 8 years, as at least for the past 2 maybe 3 I wasn't making good use of
it and the Games with Gold were not worth it.

* Xbox Games Pass
  * Call of Duty  - Black Ops 6
    * Got to Prestige Mastery (i.e. went from Level 1 to 55, 11 times).
    * Unlocked Diamond Camos on 33 weapons (this means getting 100 headshots on
      most of hose 33 weapons plus complete several other challenges).
  * It Takes Two - Almost completed it
  * Tried
    * Hollow Knight: Silksong
    * Tony Hakw's Pro Sakter 3 + 4
  * Overall, I probably aren't getting value out of this, if I do move to
    Black Ops 7, I will need to look at price of buying it out right to another 
    year or two of Games Pass../
* Spyro
    * Didn't make any progress on the third game all year.
* Diablo Immortals
    * Play at least three a week for raids and shadow wars.
    * Login almost every day to send the pets (familiars) off to complete stuff.
* lichess
  * Played 998 games and won 653, with 14,836 moves.
    * 973 Atomic and 25 Blitz
    * 908 Lobby, 41 Computer and 24 Tournaments.
  * Played 2 days and 7 hours
  * Started year with a rating of <TODO> and ended on <TODO>.
  * Longest winning streak was 30 games between 2025-02-10 to 2025-02-11
  * Longest loosing streak was 9 games on 2025-02-28.
  * Longest streak (of playtime): 2 hour 13 minutes on 2025-02-28.
  * Reached highest rating in Atomic of 1745 (August)
* Railbound
  * This was on my wish for a while and finally saw good sale so picked it up.
  * Played through the first three 'worlds'.

## Television

* Last few months of the year were distracted by Anime.
  * Solo Levelling
  * That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime
  * The Misfit of Demon King Academy
  * The Eminence in Shadow
    * I wasn't as keen on the sharp twist in season 2 where they focused more
      on the big plot points in season 2 and dropped the overall narrative (i.e
      they skipped the school setting).
  * Delicious in Dungeon
  * The Daily Life of the Immortal King - Chinese series but recommend.

* Disney+ shows
    * Star Wars: Skeleton Crew - Season 1
    * Percy Jackson and the Olympians - Season 1
    * Andor - Season 1 and 2
      * I previously watched the first episode and didn't get into it but gave
        it another chance and was happy, it started it very slow.
    * Ironheart - Season 1
      * 
    * Daredevil: Born Again - Season 1
    * Shifting Gears - Season 1
      * Prefer Home Improvement and Last Man Standing
    * Ended Disney+ subscription when it came up for renewal - price increase
      again and couldn't justify it.
* Netflix
    * SPY x FAMILY - Season 2
    * FUBAR - Season 2
    * Sirens - Season 1
    * Tomorrow - Season 1
    * You - Season 5
    * Wednesday - Season 2
    * Squid Games - Season 2 and 3
    * My Happy Marriage - Season 2
    * Ghosts (US) - Season 1 and most of Season 2
  * The Apothecary Diaries - Season 1 - **Top pick**
  * Witch Watch - Season 1 (partial)
    * Mostly watched it as LilyPichu (Twitch streamer) was the English voice
      for the main character.

## Music

This was a slow year of music as I rarely put my headphones or speakers on.

### Artists
* IVE - 129 plays
* We Are Scietnecies - 113 palys
* Taylor Swift - 111 plays
* Of Monsters and Men - 110 plays
* THe Wombnats - 96 plays

## Top Tracks

* Golden - HUNTR/X
* Rebel Heart - IVE
* I AM - IVE
  * This song sounds very similar to Golden.

## Talks

These are some technical talks that I watched.

* ["50 years in filesystems"][0] by Kristian Köhntopp given at [FrOSCon][1] 2025.
  * This sent me down a rabbit hole for about a week as I dived into the Minix
    file system before folowing the threads of 9P protcol and Network Block
    Device protocols.
* ["Podman networking deep dive"][2] by Paul Holzinger at [DevConf.CZ 2024][3].
  * Highly recommend this one for getting to know the challanages faced with
    container networking.
* ["More Than Just Quite OK – Data Compression Nerds Hate This One Trick"][4] by 
  kleines Filmröllchen at [Easterhegg 2025][6].
* ["Numerical Marvels Inside Python"][5] by Raymond Hettinger at PyData Tel
  Aviv 2022.
* ["How to become your own ISP"][7] by Nick Bouwhuis at [Why 2025][8] (What
   Hackers Yearn).
    * Introduces BGP (Border Gate Protocol) and AS (Autonomous system) numbers.
    * Covers what to acquire and where from. 
* **Bonus** - Not a technical talk but facts meets comedy.
  ["Full Comedy Special"][9] by Hank Green, if you have Dropout.tv be sure
  to watch it there.

# Things for 2024
I only did one of the items on last years TODO list for 2023 which were
the blog posts. I did think about the music and gaming page.

## Upcoming blog posts

Assuming I get around to writing them in 2026.

- Post about location generation.
- NBD Devices
- Load testing with Locust
- Quick look at ostree
- My `git` usage

I may also try to post ideas rather than experiments or dives into the, as well.
