Closing out the year 2023. An overview on some things I did, played and watched
this year.

# Things I did for 2023

* Proposed to my girlfriend.
* Moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to 4 bedroom house.
* Coding
** Started the year by working with expressing digital logic circuits in
   Python.
** Explored using Harfbuzz from Python
** Explored the RTMP protocol - verdict was the idea was not worth perusing as
   using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to record and stream a window seems to
   be way better option for my cases.
** Finally revisited converting Open Street Map data to raster tiles.
** Worked on some world-building ideas for a game I had. Hopefully in the new
   year I can get to writing up about various parts of that. I don't expect to
   complete the game itself let alone get a beta out for it.

* Set-up this this site and blog
* Purchased a domain name
* Purchased a VPS with the plan of setting up WireGuard. There were two main
  uses for WireGuard that was looking for:
    * Secure my phone when on public Wi-Fi by pushing traffic through the VPS -
      I managed to get this working
    * Access my home network from my phone when out and about - I wasn't able
      to get this working.
* Travelled on the Ghan from Alice Springs to Darwin, stopping off at Katherine
  on the way.
  Overall good trip even if it was way to hot in Darwin to be outside.
* Only went bouldering once this year.

## Games
Towards the end of the year I stopped my Xbox Live Gold subscription after
about 8 years, as at least for the past 2 maybe 3 I wasn't making good use of
it and the Games with Gold were not worth it.

* Xbox Games Pass
    * Payday 3 - This was the game that triggered my purchase of the Games Pass
      as friends wanted to play it.
    * Headbangers: Rytham Royale - My playtime and ejoyment of this easily
      justified a month of Games Pass.
    * Gotham Knights - I would never have purchased this myself but it is
      payable. The strange thing was the almost Division-like controls rather
      than traditional first or third person (i.e. like Spyro or Crash). I need
      to find some time to play it a bit more, the advantage is there is kind
      of a day-night cycle where you go out on missions and when you return that
      becomes the next day so possible to use that as a guide of one play
      session is one "return to the tower (not Bat cave).
    * Persona 5 Tactica - A work college raves about playing the Persona series
      so I figured I give it a shot. Overall, I like the turn based aspect and
      it filled the desire to have played Advantage Wars despite never having
      a Gameboy Advance.
    * Super Lucky Tale - This mostly made me regret not sitting down and
      completing the third Spyro game first.
* Call of Duty
    * Modern Warfare 3. Played the free weekend, unless it was just the free
      player part it seems like they removed the online stats which is a shame.
      Overall, the levels looked the same as the first one but better graphics
      and the best new feature was showing how many people contributed to your
      dealth. I would really need the time to play it would only
      get it if it was $40 but might consider $50.
* Spyro
    * I'm about half way through the third game.
* Magic the Gathering
    * Played paper magic in the Magic of Summer Event in December.
    * Only played a few games of Brawl on Arena (the computer game version).
      The motivating factor was the mastery tree had a Gishath Avatar which is
      my commander in game and on paper.
* Diablo Immortals
    * I still played way too much of this game.
    * They did sucker me in as they regularly releasing new content.
    * I haven't played the new top-down tower defence mode, which really seemed
      like it originated because some NetEase developers were tasked with
      writing a new game and decided to build it inside Diablo Immortals to
      prototype and then someone decided "hey, that is fun, we can theme it
      and ship it".
* lichess
  * Played 571 games
  * Started year with a rating of 969 and ended on 1054.
  * Longest winning streak was 10 games between 2023-09-07 to 2023-09-09.
  * Longest streak (of playtime): 1 hour 21 minutes on 2023-03-11.
  * Reached highest raiting in blitz of 1110.

   Business Proposal and then "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim" while waiting
   for new episodes to drop.

## Music

### Artists
* British India
* Say Hi
* She & Him
* San Cisco
* BUMP OF CHICKEN (Theme song for Spy vs Family)

## Top Tracks

* Lollipop (Candyman) - Aqua
* Doctor Jones - Aqua
* I Can Make You Love Me - British India
* Wrong Direction - British India
* Better Off Alone - Alice Deejay

For Lollipop, the catalyst for listening to that was a clip of Magnus Carlsen
playing chess while hanging out with the Botez sisters (Chess streamers) with
the song in the background.

For British India, I don't really remember listening to the songs themselves it
must have more been Spotify got stuck on a playlist. Likewise for
Better Off Alone but that might have been it was a feature on a  playlist that
also included several Ace of Base songs.

# Things for 2024
