Hello, I am Sean otherwise known as Donno.
I am a Software engineer working in Adelaide, South Australia.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Past

I started with QBASIC before moving on to Visual Basic 6, and later on in
2003/2004 I started writing Python scripts for XBMC (Xbox Media Center) at the
time before learning some C++ for working with XBMC.

### XBMC
I worked on and with XBMC (formerly Xbox Media Center and now known as Kodi).
I stopped working on it around 2008 due to not having time between study and
because at the time I wasn't using XBMC as much as I once did.

A few things I worked on:
* Enabled Python scripts to define their user interface using the same system
 as native features (i.e using the XML skinning engine).
* Original YouTube Python script
* Game save manager - The motivation was to remove the need for switching to
  another dashboard as meant you could basically stick to XBMC and games.

### University Project

- Using LLVM with QEMU. The basic idea was to take basic blocks of ARM code
  and generate translations to AMD64 using LLVM and using that code instead of
  TCG when it was smaller (by copying the code over the TCG code).

## Gaming

My go to video game is first person shooter in a multilayer setting where the
typical match times are around 10 to 15 minutes. I typically avoid role playing
gamings and thus games with long stories and open worlds.

More details are listed on [Gaming][/gaming.html].

## Books

* Jack Reacher series - Lee Child.\
  I started with One Shot which is the book the first feature film is based on
  but the ninth book in the series. I read forward from there before jumping
  back to the first novel. I think I stopped at A Wanted Man and thus never got
  to Never Go Back which the second feature film is based on.
* Imperial Radch / Ancillary Justice series - by Ann Leckie\
  An ancillary is humanoid that has been augmented to become part of a
  spaceship and carrying out the command of hte spaceship to maintain and look
  after it. It is reminiscent of Rommie (ship's avatar) from Andromeda but
  rather than being androids they are human turned cyborg.
* Vorkosigan Saga (2021 to 2022) - by Lois McMaster Bujold\
  I started with "The Warrior's Apprentice" and went forward following
  chronological, taking a break to read "Falling Free" after "Mirror Dance" and
  later reading the two Cordelia. This worked well as "Falling Free" covers the
  history needed for a book late in the serious.
  I was hooked on these novels and found myself reading multiple chapters a
  a night. Once I was invested in Mile's story I just had to read more about
  the history of the galaxy ("Falling Free") and his parents.
* Night Watch - 2022 - by Terry Pratchett and part of the Discworld series.\
  I went into it not knowing what to expect as I did no prior research on the
  series or the book. The introduction was slow to the universe and as a result
  started off reading slowly and often putting it down. However, that changed
  once the massive plot device came along and turned it into a story I could
  not put down. I am however undecided if I will continue the series as while
  this forms part of the "Watch Novels" it is very late in that timeline.
* Codex Alera series - Jim Butcher.\
  Starts with slowly introducing the world and starts off unclear who the
  protagonist of the series is. It took me a while to read through the first
  book, bit quicker on the next, but then from about the third book onwards I
  picked up the pace and wouldn't put it down. It follows multiple characters
  which reminded me of the later Vorkosigan books and it means you aren't only
  experience the world from one perspective. I did find it difficult to follow
  the time of time in the series as it was unclear to me what was happening at
  the same time as well as naturally getting sense of how long certain travel
  takes. Overall, the conclusion of the series is satisfying and a very natural
  place to end.

Other books I've read in 2020s were:
- City of Bones by 	Cassandra Clare - The first in the Shadow Hunter series
  and after the show finished decided to watch the first episode again and
  read the book to compare.
- How to Avoid a Climate Disaster - Bill Gates
- Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson.

During High school:
- The Alchemist's Key by Traci Harding
- The Ancient Future by Traci Harding - Didn't hold my interest as much as
  The Alchemist's Key and I didn't continue with the series. I may have read
  some of An Echo in Time, the second book in the series.
The above list of high school excludes any course work.

## Music

## YouTube

Since about 2018, I regularly watch YouTube, specially with more media outlets
producing YouTube content or simply sharing their content.

The channels I initially followed were:
* CinemaSins
* How It Should have Ended
* Geek & Sundry
* minutephysics
* SCiShow
* Vihart

Completed series
* Space Janitors
* NerdHQ which was renamed to Wyldwood in 2020. The conversation for a cause
  were great. Unfortunately, once I had caught up on past ones they were giving
  that year a miss and seeing how things go the year after.

Past channels:
* The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon - this was mostly around the time he
  just took over. So rarely seen clips since 2010. I would also often watch
  the Seth Myers clips too.*
* Savjz - When he started streaming Magic the Gathering: Arena rather than
  Heartstone. By the time I completed his back catalogue on MTG, he had stopped
  playing and moved to auto-chess before going back to Hearthstone. Overall it
  was understable as while his MTG content was good it was not getting him the
  views.

Others

* Vihart - Mathematics and hexaflexagon
* The Command Zone - For Magic the Gathering, Commander. I don't watch the
  podcasts or talking heads.
* triple j for Like a Versions.
* Mark Rober - Squirrel Maze was the introduction I had for this channel.
* Jimmy Rees - "Meanwhile in Australia" series. Once border closures and lock
  downs stopped for COVID-19 he moved on. The former series is very topical and
  worked best knowing the current events at the time, I would suggest the
  "Guy who Decides" series.
* Mattias Krantz - Piano modifications.
* Rob Landes / Marcus Veltri - Violinist and Pianist - Omegle song requests.
* Jolly
* Tingman - Twisty Puzzles - This channel convinced me to order a 3x3 puzzle
  (Rubik Cube) and learn to solve it.
* HarvardTHUD - Boomwhackers
* Taskmaster (UK) - With the number of clips I watched it would have been
  better if I started watching full episodes on local free-to-air. I did
  however watch a full episode of the Denmark version as that was available on
  the official YouTube channel. It was great getting to see different people
  doing the same tasks as the UK series.

## Hobbies

* Magic the Gathering.
  * Commander - My main commander is Gishath, Sun's Avatar.
  * Draft
    * Drafted GRN, RNA, WAR, M20, ELD and IKO. Lockdowns due to COVID-19 made
      it difficult to play paper.
  * Sealed
* Twisty Puzzles - Rubix Cubes
  * Due to YouTube's algorithm, it suggested a video on twisty puzzles, and
    one video turned into more until it often would show multiple videos
    each time. Eventually, decided that it was time to purchase some so
    ordered a 3x3, Pyraminx and Megaminx. Next order a Square-1 and Skweb.
  * For 3x3, my solve time is about 65 seconds average on a good day, and 90
    seconds to 120 seconds on a bad and during a blunder.
  * For 4x4, my first attempt took an hour or two, and second took about 30
    minutes, still needed help for some of it.
  * For Pyraminx, I haven't tried speed solving and after many months without
    solving one, I probably would struggle. Likewise for the Skewb.
  * I haven't learnt to solve the Square-1 or Megaminx yet (2022).
  * I hope to at least participate in a World Cube Association (WCA) event when
    one is in my city.

## Education
