## Play through

These are games that I've played through and wanted to share. Perhaps at some
point I will go into more detail, if its to far into the future.

* Tom Clancy's The Division. Play time was 2 days 19 hours and 30 minutes.
  Completed all the main story and completed most if not all collectibles in
  the base game, didn't have the DLC but did play a bit of the survival mode
  in free week-end.

* Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends\
  Both were game I received through the Games with Gold for Xbox Live.
  I completed the main story line but didn't 100% all the levels.

* Tomb Raider (2013)\
  This was a Games with Gold and basically paid for Xbox Live Gold that year.
  I was hooked and played through the entire story and did all the
  collectibles. I didn't complete the achievements, as many were either for
  multilayer or were very tricky to get without replaying key parts of the
  story. **Highly recommend**

* Spyro Reignited Trilogy (2018)\
  I've completed the first two games and am on to the third.
  I had previously played portions of original games on PlayStation, taking
  turns with my brothers.

## Near play through
* It Takes Two (2021) \
  Played this with my now wife, and I would recommend it to another living with
  their partner or sibling. It did feel rather like two games, where it dragged
  on just a bit too much to the point where the latter part felt more like it
  should have been a downloadable content / an expansion.
  Play time was 11 hours and 28 minutes but haven't quite finished it yet.
  Started playing it in October 2024, with most playtime in early 2025.
  This one was available through EA via the Xbox Games Pass on PC.
* STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order (2019). \
  It had been a while since playing a first person Stars Wars game with a
  story. I did almost give up at one point as I struggled with the climbing
  up of an AT-AT and nearly put the game down for a while. It reminded me of
  Tomb Raider 2013 as there are similar mechanic to the camp fires.
  Play time to date is 7 hours.
  This one was available through EA via the Xbox Games Pass on PC.
