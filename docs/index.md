## Past

I started with QBASIC before moving on to Visual Basic 6, and later on in
2003/2004 I started writing Python scripts for XBMC (Xbox Media Center) at the
time before learning some C++ for working with XBMC.

### XBMC
I worked on and with XBMC (formerly Xbox Media Center and now known as Kodi).
I stopped working on it around 2008 due to not having time between study and
because at the time I wasn't using XBMC as much as I once did.

A few things I worked on:
* Enabled Python scripts to define their user interface using the same system
 as native features (i.e using the XML skinning engine).
* Original YouTube Python script
* Game save manager - The motivation was to remove the need for switching to
  another dashboard as meant you could basically stick to XBMC and games.

### University Project

- Using LLVM with QEMU. The basic idea was to take basic blocks of ARM code
  and generate translations to AMD64 using LLVM and using that code instead of
  TCG when it was smaller (by copying the code over the TCG code).

## Gaming

### Play through

These are games that I've played through and wanted to share. Perhaps at some
point I will go into more detail, if its to far into the future.

* Tom Clancy's The Division. Play time was 2 days 19 hours and 30 minutes.
  Completed all the main story and completed most if not all collectibles in
  the base game, didn't have the DLC but did play a bit of the survival mode
  in free week-end.

* Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends\
  Both were game I received through the Games with Gold for Xbox Live.
  I completed the main story line but didn't 100% all the levels.

* Tomb Raider (2013)\
  This was a Games with Gold and basically paid for Xbox Live Gold that year.
  I was hooked and played through the entire story and did all the
  collectibles. I didn't complete the achievements, as many were either for
  multilayer or were very tricky to get without replaying key parts of the
  story. **Highly recommend**

* Spyro Reignited Trilogy (2018)\
  I've completed the first two games and am on to the third.
  I had previously played portions of original games on PlayStation, taking
  turns with my brothers.
