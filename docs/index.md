Hello, I am Sean otherwise known as Donno.
I am a Software engineer working in Adelaide, South Australia.

## Past

I started with QBASIC before moving on to Visual Basic 6, and later on in
2003/2004 I started writing Python scripts for XBMC (Xbox Media Center) at the
time before learning some C++ for working with XBMC.

### XBMC
I worked on and with XBMC (formerly Xbox Media Center and now known as Kodi).
I stopped working on it around 2008 due to not having time between study and
because at the time I wasn't using XBMC as much as I once did.

A few things I worked on:
* Enabled Python scripts to define their user interface using the same system
 as native features (i.e using the XML skinning engine).
* Original YouTube Python script
* Game save manager - The motivation was to remove the need for switching to
  another dashboard as meant you could basically stick to XBMC and games.

### University Project

- Using LLVM with QEMU. The basic idea was to take basic blocks of ARM code
  and generate translations to AMD64 using LLVM and using that code instead of
  TCG when it was smaller (by copying the code over the TCG code).

## Gaming

### Play through

These are games that I've played through and wanted to share. Perhaps at some
point I will go into more detail, if its to far into the future.

* Tom Clancy's The Division. Play time was 2 days 19 hours and 30 minutes.
  Completed all the main story and completed most if not all collectibles in
  the base game, didn't have the DLC but did play a bit of the survival mode
  in free week-end.

* Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends\
  Both were game I received through the Games with Gold for Xbox Live.
  I completed the main story line but didn't 100% all the levels.

* Tomb Raider (2013)\
  This was a Games with Gold and basically paid for Xbox Live Gold that year.
  I was hooked and played through the entire story and did all the
  collectibles. I didn't complete the achievements, as many were either for
  multilayer or were very tricky to get without replaying key parts of the
  story. **Highly recommend**

* Spyro Reignited Trilogy (2018)\
  I've completed the first two games and am on to the third.
  I had previously played portions of original games on PlayStation, taking
  turns with my brothers.

### Regularly - Daily/Weekly

These are games that I've played regularly at some point or the other.

* Call on Duty: Black Ops III. Played on Xbox.
* Starwars Battlefront - (2015-12 to 2017-06) Play time 15 days 3 hours
  1 minute, 16,222 kills and 8 million score. Played on Xbox.
* Overwatch to 2019-11. - Play time 631 hours (371 quick play, 226 arcade an
  32 comp).  Heroes - D.VA 92 hours , Mei 66 hours, Orisa 63 hours.
  In competitive - Orisa, Mercy, Rein, D.VA and Ana were most played heroes.
* PUBG (2019-11 to 2020-04) - Play time 252 hours.
* MTG Arena - Beta till about 2020.
* Call of Duty - Warzone (2020-06 till Modern Warfare)
* Call of Duty - Modern Warfare (2020-07-11)
* Diablo Immortals  (2022-06 to 2022-09)

## Books

* Jack Reacher series - Lee Child.
  I started with One Shot which is the book the first feature film is based on
  but the ninth book in the series. I read forward from there before jumping
  back to the first novel. I think I stopped at A Wanted Man and thus never got
  to Never Go Back which the second feature film is based on.
* Imperial Radch / Ancillary Justice series - by Ann Leckie
  An ancillary is humanoid that has been augmented to become part of a
  spaceship and carrying out the command of hte spaceship to maintain and look
  after it. It is reminiscent of Rommie (ship's avatar) from Andromeda but
  rather than being androids they are human turned cyborg.
* Vorkosigan Saga (2021 to 2022) - by Lois McMaster Bujold
  I started with "The Warrior's Apprentice" and went forward following
  chronological, taking a break to read "Falling Free" after "Mirror Dance" and
  later reading the two Cordelia. This worked well as "Falling Free" covers the
  history needed for a book late in the serious.
  I was hooked on these novels and found myself reading multiple chapters a
  a night. Once I was invested in Mile's story I just had to read more about
  the history of the galaxy ("Falling Free") and his parents.
* Night Watch - 2022 - by Terry Pratchett and part of the Discworld series.
  I went into it not knowing what to expect as I did no prior research on the
  series or the book. The introduction was slow to the universe and as a result
  started off reading slowly and often putting it down. However, that changed
  once the massive plot device came along and turned it into a story I could
  not put down. I am however undecided if I will continue the series as while
  this forms part of the "Watch Novels" it is very late in that timeline.

Other books I've read in 2020s were:
- City of Bones by 	Cassandra Clare - The first in the Shadow Hunter series
  and after the show finished decided to watch the first episode again and
  read the book to compare.
- How to Avoid a Climate Disaster - Bill Gates
- Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson.

During High school:
- The Alchemist's Key by Traci Harding
- The Ancient Future by Traci Harding - Didn't hold my interest as much as
  The Alchemist's Key and I didn't continue with the series. I may have read
  some of An Echo in Time, the second book in the series.
The above list of high school excludes any course work.
