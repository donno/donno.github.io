title:  "Using OSRM - Open Source Routing Machine"

Open Source Routing Machine ([OSRM][1]) is the a C++ routing engine for
shortest paths in road networks. It can be used for suggesting directions
between two locations, which is what I am hoping to use it for. Its data source
is [OpenStreetMap][2] and it can process the osm.pbf (protocol buffer files).

There are two pre-processing pipelines available:
* Contraction Hierarchies (CH)
* Multi-Level Dijkstra (MLD)

I've used the second one (MLD) due to having better success with that.
The partition and customise step below are replaced with a single contract
step using `osrm-contract`.

Another open source routing engine for OpenStreetMap is [Valhalla](12). I had
intended to use this one initially, however I stumbled upon more information
for OSRM so went with that. This project also seems to do more than just
routing such as elevation (which seems to be for biking/walking as it
accounts for steepness during routing).

## Data Preparation

* Download software from [Releases][3] on GitHub. I used version 5.27.1 for
  Windows (node_osrm-v5.27.1-node-v93-win32-x64-Release.tar.gz)
* Download a relevant [OpenStreetMap Data Extract][4] from [Geofabrik][5].
  For my projects I downloaded:
    * [Australia][6]
    * [US Northeast][7]
* Perform the extraction step
  ```
  D:\Programs\Development\osrm\osrm-extract.exe `
    --profile=D:\Programs\Development\osrm\profiles\car.lua `
    G:\GeoData\Source\OpenStreetMap\osm\australia-oceania-2022-10-22.osm.pbf
  ```
* Perform the partition step
  ```
  D:\programs\development\osrm\osrm-partition.exe `
    "G:\GeoData\Source\OpenStreetMap\osm\australia-oceania-2022-10-22.osrm"
  ```
* Perform the customise step
  ```
  D:\programs\development\osrm\osrm-customize.exe `
    "G:\GeoData\Source\OpenStreetMap\osm\australia-oceania-2022-10-22.osrm"
  ```
* Start web server for hosting the data. For a given data set, this is all you
  need going forward.
  ```
  D:\Programs\Development\osrm\osrm-routed.exe --algorithm mld `
    "G:\GeoData\Source\OpenStreetMap\osm\australia-oceania-2022-10-22.osrm"
  ```

Important note is it doesn't generate a 'osrm' file which means tab completion
in a terminal is not perfect. It a shame that it doesn't create a <name>.osrm
directory instead as that would benefit tab completion and make it clearer that
<input.osrm> is that folder.

## Problems

The big problem I faced before using osrm-routed was I was trying to use the
[routing.cpp example][8]. It kept coming back as no distance etc which made me
I had mucked up the creation of the osrm files.

## Results
For Australia, the source data was 605MB and the OSRM data was 2.05GB.
For US North East, the source data was 1.33GB and the OSRM data was 6.51GB.

For the HTTP API, the coordinates are longitude then comma then latitude pairs
with the pairs separated by a semicolon (;).

For testing your coordinates and comparing it against the
[demonstration system][9] hosted by the OSRM project. Unfortunately, the web
front-end takes coordinates in latitude than longitude rather than the other
way around like the back-end.

In this example we try to compute the route between Queen's Ct in Adelaide to
Spencer Street, nearby.

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/route/v1/driving/138.588700255592,-34.9255684682013;138.589492995401,-34.9266129382409?steps=true
```

Expected output:
```
{
    "waypoints": [{
        "name": "Queen's Court",
        "location": [138.588695, -34.925484],
        "distance": 9.330084896,
        "hint": "_-4OgALvDoAOAAAADQAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4DmFQZECXUEAAAAAAAAAAA4AAAANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChEAAAF7JCCFQU6_0cskIIABTr_QAAvxCwtqXD"
    }, {
        "name": "Spencer Street",
        "location": [138.589497, -34.926675],
        "distance": 6.887933993,
        "hint": "3u0OgP___38VAAAARwAAAAAAAAAAAAAADCltQWyzCkIAAAAAAAAAABUAAABHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChEAAAObVCCK0P6_01tUII6w_r_QAAvxCwtqXD"
    }],
    "routes": [ <omitted> ],
}
```

Same query on the [demonstration front-end][10].

## Next
The next stage of what I want to do with this is draw the path on a map.

As well as the [OSRM Text Instructions][11], assuming that is the component
that produces the navigation system-like text of the form:
* Head north on King's Court (55m)
* Turn left onto Currie Street (100m)

## Other uses

The library provides several other operations other than directions between
two locations (a route). It also supports directions between multiple
locations.

The other tasks it can perform are:
* Snapping coordinates to the street network and returns the nearest matches.
* Computing the duration or distances of the fastest route between all pairs of
  supplied coordinates.
* Snapping noisy GPS traces to the road network in the most plausible way.
* Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic.
* Generating Mapbox Vector Tiles with internal routing metadata.
