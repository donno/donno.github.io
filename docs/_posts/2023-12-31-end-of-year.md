Closing out the year 2023. An overview on some things I did, played and watched
this year.

# Things I did for 2023

* Proposed to my girlfriend.
* Moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to 4 bedroom house.
* Coding
** Started the year by working with expressing digital logic circuits in
   Python.
** Explored using Harfbuzz from Python
** Explored the RTMP protocol - verdict was the idea was not worth perusing as
   using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to record and stream a window seems to
   be way better option for my cases.
** Finally revisited converting Open Street Map data to raster tiles.
** Worked on some world-building ideas for a game I had. Hopefully in the new
   year I can get to writing up about various parts of that. I don't expect to
   complete the game itself let alone get a beta out for it.
* Went bouldering a couple of times this year except the closest gym is closing
  in January 2024 which is a shame as I was thinking of getting a membership.

## Games
Towards the end of the year I stopped my Xbox Live Gold subscription after
about 8 years, as at least for the past 2 maybe 3 I wasn't making good use of
it and the Games with Gold were not worth it.

* Xbox Games Pass
    * Payday 3 - This was the game that triggered my purchase of the Games Pass
      as friends wanted to play it.
    * Headbangers: Rhythm Royale - My playtime and enjoyment of this easily
      justified a month of Games Pass.
    * Gotham Knights - I would never have purchased this myself but it is
      payable. The strange thing was the almost Division-like controls rather
      than traditional first or third person (i.e. like Spyro or Crash). I need
      to find some time to play it a bit more, the advantage is there is kind
      of a day-night cycle where you go out on missions and when you return that
      becomes the next day so possible to use that as a guide of one play
      session is one "return to the tower (not Bat cave).
    * Persona 5 Tactica - A work college raves about playing the Persona series
      so I figured I give it a shot. Overall, I like the turn based aspect and
      it filled the desire to have played Advantage Wars despite never having
      a Gameboy Advance.
    * Super Lucky Tale - This mostly made me regret not sitting down and
      completing the third Spyro game first.
* Call of Duty
    * Modern Warfare 3. Played the free weekend, unless it was just the free
      player part it seems like they removed the online stats which is a shame.
      Overall, the levels looked the same as the first one but better graphics
      and the best new feature was showing how many people contributed to your
      deaths. I would really need the time to play it would only
      get it if it was $40 but might consider $50.
* Spyro
    * I'm about half way through the third game.
* Magic the Gathering
    * Played paper magic in the Magic of Summer Event in December.
    * Only played a few games of Brawl on Arena (the computer game version).
      The motivating factor was the mastery tree had a Gishath Avatar which is
      my commander in game and on paper.
* Diablo Immortals
    * I still played way too much of this game.
    * They did sucker me in as they regularly releasing new content.
    * I haven't played the new top-down tower defence mode, which really seemed
      like it originated because some NetEase developers were tasked with
      writing a new game and decided to build it inside Diablo Immortals to
      prototype and then someone decided "hey, that is fun, we can theme it
      and ship it".
* lichess
  * Played 571 games
  * Started year with a rating of 969 and ended on 1054.
  * Longest winning streak was 10 games between 2023-09-07 to 2023-09-09.
  * Longest streak (of playtime): 1 hour 21 minutes on 2023-03-11.
  * Reached highest rating in blitz of 1110.

   Business Proposal and then "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim" while waiting
   for new episodes to drop.

## Music

### Artists
* British India
* Say Hi
* She & Him
* San Cisco
* BUMP OF CHICKEN (Theme song for Spy vs Family)

## Top Tracks

* Lollipop (Candyman) - Aqua
* Doctor Jones - Aqua
* I Can Make You Love Me - British India
* Wrong Direction - British India
* Better Off Alone - Alice Deejay

For Lollipop, the catalyst for listening to that was a clip of Magnus Carlsen
playing chess while hanging out with the Botez sisters (Chess streamers) with
the song in the background.

For British India, I don't really remember listening to the songs themselves it
must have more been Spotify got stuck on a playlist. Likewise for
Better Off Alone but that might have been it was a feature on a playlist that
also included several Ace of Base songs.

# Things for 2024
