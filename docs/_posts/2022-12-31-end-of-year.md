# Things I did for 2022

* Set-up this this site and blog
* Purchased a domain name
* Purchased a VPS with the plan of setting up WireGuard. There were two main
  uses for WireGuard that was looking for:
    * Secure my phone when on public Wi-Fi by pushing traffic through the VPS -
      I managed to get this working
    * Access my home network from my phone when out and about - I wasn't able
      to get this working.
* Travelled on the Ghan from Alice Springs to Darwin, stopping off at Katherine
  on the way.
  Overall good trip even if it was way to hot in Darwin to be outside.
* Only went bouldering once this year.

## Games
* Halo Infinity
    * Mostly I've played this with controller however in December I tried it
      with keyboard and mouse and things went a lot better. I was able to 
      contribute more for my team and get a reasonable kill streak.
* Overwatch 2
    * I mostly miss the original Overwatch, the single tank, two damage and two
      support set-up sucks bad when you don't have a group. Often you end up in
      games where you stuck as support and you just watching on as your team
      can't pick off anyone from the other team. I've heard that things are
      better if you play competitive (i.e playing support is a lot more viable
      there), so may need to look at that in 2023.
    * They have hidden the statistics and information that would give you clues
      as to how much practice someone has at the game which adds to the
      frustration. In Overwatch 1 it was easy to see how much hours someone had
      played for, and with Overwatch 2 being free to play it means there is a
      lower barrier for entry.
* Call of Duty
    * Warzone
        * The King Kong vs Godzilla event was great.
        * The new map for Warzone 2 doesn't feel as detailed or polished as the
          original map.
    * Due to the introduction of Overwatch 2, I haven't played Modern Warfare as
      much as I did.
    * Modern Warfare 2
        * I played during the free week.
        * Compared with Vanguard and Black Ops, this one felt worth it. The
          guns didn't have that old and slow feeling which was a huge plus.
        * Not worth the $100 price tag, where ideally like to see it at $40 but
          would do $50.
* Spyro
    * Completed the main story of first two games with over 70% completion in each.
    * Started the third game, but only completed the first world/zone so far.
* Rise of Tomb Raider
    * Steam Replay reported that I spent 53% of my playtime on Steam in this
      game however that was all in January. It would
    * Based on the achievements, I may have completed in back in January 1 as
      it lists the achievement "The Price of Truth" which is finish the game on
      any difficult as unlocked.
* MultiVersus
    * Steam replay reported this was 12% of my total playtime on Steam this year.
    * This really scratches the Super Smash Brothers itch.
* Magic the Gathering
    * Didn't attend any pre-release or in-store events.
    * Only played a few games of Brawl on Arena (the computer game version).
* Diablo Immortals
    * I played way too much of this game after getting introduced to it by a co-worker.
    * I was luckily enough to get a chance to be an immortal and the intention
      was to stop playing shortly after that.
    * The plan to stop didn't happen as they kept regularly releasing new
      content to keep me in.

## Television

* In 2022, I was introduced to the world of K-Dramas, starting off with with
   Business Proposal and then "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim" while waiting
   for new episodes to drop.
* Disney+ shows
    * Obi Wan
    * Book of Fett
    * She Hulk
* Netflix
    * Wednesday - Season 1
    * Fate: The Winx Saga - Season 2
    * Rick and Morty - Season 6
    * The Sandman - Season 1
    * Extraordinary Attorney Woo - Season 1
    * Alice in Borderland  - Season 1
    * Titans - Season 3
    * Business Proposal - Season 1
    * Crash Landing into You - Season 1

# Things for 2023

## Upcoming blog posts

These are based on things that I did in 2022 so they may be back-dated if I
don't spend to much time during writing them up, revisiting them.
* Rendering OpenStreet Map to raster then to Tag Image File Format (TIFF)
* Digital Logic project - describing digital logic circuits and either
  executing or drawing them.
* My relaxtolife project - creating calendar from known things I did 
    * This comes from Call of Duty, FitBit (Sleep and exercise).
    * I may need to look at adding my lichess matches to this.
    * I may also need to look at extending this to Strava as I used that
      instead of FitBit for tracking exercise over a 12 week period this year.
* GamesMap format used in Wolf3D and Keen4.
* Posts about my personal history centered around particular theme
    * Media players 
    * Games
    * Operating systems

## Upcoming site ideas
* Separate music pages for artist vs song broken down by month
* Use GitHub issues/discussion for blog comments
