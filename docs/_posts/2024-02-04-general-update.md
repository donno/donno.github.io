It is already February and I haven't had any technical weekend project to post
about. I wanted decided to write general post to update what this year has been
like so far.


## Palworld

I got very into Palworld since its release, I was probably due for another dive
into a Minecraft mod-pack. Another play through of Minecraft would have been
difficult. I have already played through several of the main skyblock style
ones. The only mod that I hadn't explored was  the chemistry one that goes deep
into the elements.

The main aspect of Palworld that was just what I was after was the technology
tree and thus the progression. It starts you off small and gives you a path
forward to slowly build-up on.

The capture of Pal to use as a workforce in your bases is always a great
aspect. Compared to to the Minecraft mods I had played, you don't have to wait
till late game to have things automated. Having said that, I first caught the
sheep but later realised the cat was the real most-valuable catch of the early
game as it is so versatility as it can mine, transport and craft (handiwork).

The mistake I made was getting distracted by trying to capture each of the
first 20 types. This set me back in player levels as you are rewarded more
experience and thus progression by capturing 10 of a kind. I really needed to
focus on capturing 10 of a kind of the first few low level pals. The result of
this is it meant the pals in my party were starting to out level me.

I had caught 20 different types of Pals in the first 2 days of release of the
game and 50 different types in the first 5 days. On the other hand, I was slow
at defeating the first tower / boss fight.

It was very tempting to take a break from playing early on and creating a
Paldeck application or least web page with local storage with the list of Pals
to keep track of how many of each I had captured for that sweet experience
bonus on my phone.

I been playing solo to date and am looking forward to playing a bit more but
I'm keen to go ahead with co-op, that however will wait until the multi-player
has been sorted out.

## Other things

* I've been visiting potential wedding venues.
* I've had a solar system fixed where in the end everything but the panels
  themselves were replaced including the fixtures to the roof.
* The movies I've watched were Everything Everywhere All at Once, Sonic the
  Hedgehog 2, Love is in the Air, Leo and Lift.
* The television shows I've watched were The Artful Dodger, Pokemon Concierge
  and the end of My Demon.
* Coding wise I was looking at creating triangulation from a digital elevation
  model however it not quite there yet to post about it in depth. The promising
  approach was using [delatin][0] which does the heavy lifting, but I was
  hoping to be able to explore individual parts of it from point selection to
  the triangulation.
