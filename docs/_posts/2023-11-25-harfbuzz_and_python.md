I explored using [Harfbuzz][0] which is a text shaping library that is able to
read a font file (TrueType font, .ttf) and convert a sequence of Unicode (text)
into properly formatted and positioned glyph output. My goal was to create
3D geometry from it, be it flat.

My starting point was using [vharfbuzz][1] which made using Harfbuzz look easy.
It does indeed provide a user-friendlier way to use Harfbuzz in Python. The
thing it brought most to the table for me was the SVG output. It demonstrated
the basics of what is possible with the library. The key part is it shows that
it can issue a series of draw commands and doesn't try to rasteriser the text
itself. The other thing it does help with is it handles the set-up of
the underlying library so I could focus on my initial part.

`vharfbuzz` is a wrapper over the top of [uharfbuzz][2] which is a Cython
bindings for the HarfBuzz. The binding has a few nice minor niceties that make
the library not too C-like, but does take several function calls to setup.

My goal was for each glyph produce generate a series of (X, Y) coordinates that
defined a line. In this case most the lines are closed so they form a polygon.

I didn't fancy having to parse the SVG output and instead looked at providing
my own draw functions to `uharfbuzz` instead.

The interface that you have to implement is very similar to a path found in
various libraries such as Qt, Skia and Canvas. It requires the following
five functions:
* Move to
* Line To
* Cubic to
* Quadratic to
* Close path

In this case the `uharfbuzz` makes it even easier by making the eventual
draw glyph call take as input the object that you with to pass to each of the
functions above.

The following shows each path that was produced coloured by a different colour.
For the letter e, this shows that the semi-circle shape that is in the top of
the letter is handled as a different path, likewise the letter o has an inner
and outer circle.

Now that the text was drawn to a state where I was happy with it, I removed
`vharfbuzz` from the project. This was made possible because I already put in
place enough abstraction that could deal with the several lines of set-up and
I wasn't using the extra things the former library provides.

## BÃ©zier curves
The top-left of the letter f contained a Bezier curves when shaped. At this
point I had simple written out the end point so it goes straight from start to
end ignoring the control point.

![The letter f with no Bezier](/assets/2023-11-25-letter_f_stage_0.png)

My initial few attempts failed as seen here:

![The letter f with failed attempt to add curve](/assets/2023-11-25-letter_f_stage_1.png)
![The letter f with another failed attempt to add curve](/assets/2023-11-25-letter_f_stage_2.png)
![The letter f with another failed attempt to add curve](/assets/2023-11-25-letter_f_stage_3.png)

I eventually pin-pointed the cause of this. The inputs to approximating a
quadratic Bezier curve is a starting point, a control point and an end point.
The problem was my starting point had an offset applied where which wasn't
also applied to the control or end points. Fixing this by subtracting the
offset from the first point addressed the issue.

The thing that should have given this away was when I changed my test data to
be the string `fffffff` and so future along in the sequence the more messed up
it was getting as the offset adding up.

```python
def quadratic_to(c1x, c1y, x, y, lines):
    def bezier_formula_quadratic(start, t):
        start_x, start_y = start
        return (
            (1 - t) * (1 - t) * start_x + 2 * (1 - t) * t * c1x + t * t * x,
            (1 - t) * (1 - t) * start_y + 2 * (1 - t) * t * c1y + t * t * y,
        )

    start_x, start_y = lines.last_point_without_offset
    division = 10
    for i in range(1, division):
        new_x, new_y = bezier_formula_quadratic(
            (start_x, start_y), i / division)
        lines.add_to_current_line(new_x, new_y)
```

## Code
The code can be found in [text_to_lines.py][4] my repository called
[warehouse51][4]. For the version at the time of this blog post that is commit
[5da9c942ac][5].

## Skia

Hooking up [uharfbuzz][2] to Skia was quite straight forward. This is because
as mentioned before, the draw functions mirror that of a path. So defining
the 5 functions to call the relevant function on a `skia.Path` object and
then setting up the draw call to pass that in as well as apply the suitable
translations on the `skia.Canvas` was all it took.

```python
import skia
import uharfbuzz
```

### Draw Functions
```python
def draw_functions():
    """The draw functions calls onto skia.Path functions."""
    def cubic_to(c1x, c1y, c2x, c2y, x, y, path):
        path.cubeTo(c1x, c1y, c2x, c2y, x, y)

    def quadratic_to(c1x, c1y, x, y, path):
        path.quadTo(c1x, c1y, x, y)

    functions = uharfbuzz.DrawFuncs()
    functions.set_move_to_func(lambda x, y, path: path.moveTo(x, y))
    functions.set_line_to_func(lambda x, y, path: path.lineTo(x, y))
    functions.set_cubic_to_func(cubic_to)
    functions.set_quadratic_to_func(quadratic_to)
    functions.set_close_path_func(lambda path: path.close())
    return functions
```

### Render function
The render function creates a canvas, draws the glyphs onto it and then saves
it to a Portable Network Graphic (PNG) file.

```python
def render(harfbuzz_font, text: str, destination: str):
    # Setup the text shaper.
    buffer = uharfbuzz.Buffer()
    buffer.add_str(text)
    buffer.guess_segment_properties()
    uharfbuzz.shape(harfbuzz_font, buffer, features=None,
                    shapers=None)

    font_extents = harfbuzz_font.get_font_extents('ltr')
    y_cursor = -font_extents.descender
    x_cursor = 0
    draw_funcs = draw_functions()

    # Start drawing.
    width = sum(position.x_advance for position in buffer.glyph_positions)
    height = font_extents.ascender - font_extents.descender
    surface = skia.Surface(width, height)

    paint = skia.Paint(Color=skia.Color(15, 98, 254), StrokeWidth=2)

    with surface as canvas:
        for info, pos in zip(buffer.glyph_infos, buffer.glyph_positions):
            path = skia.Path()

            harfbuzz_font.draw_glyph(info.codepoint, draw_funcs, path)
            canvas.translate(pos.x_offset, pos.y_offset)
            canvas.drawPath(path, paint)
            canvas.translate(-pos.x_offset, -pos.y_offset)
            canvas.translate(pos.x_advance, pos.y_advance)

            x_cursor += pos.x_advance
            y_cursor += pos.y_advance

    image = surface.makeImageSnapshot()
    image.save(destination, skia.kPNG)
```

### Usage
The following snippet does use the `Font` class from [text_to_lines.py][5].

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    font = Font('consola.ttf')
    render(font.harfbuzz_font, 'Hello World!', 'hello_world.png')
```

This isn't too difficult to remove as the following would work:

```python
def load_font(font_path: str):
    # Load the font.
    blob = uharfbuzz.Blob.from_file_path(font_path)
    face = uharfbuzz.Face(blob)
    font = uharfbuzz.Font(face)
    font.scale = (face.upem, face.upem)
    uharfbuzz.ot_font_set_funcs(font)
    return font

if __name__ == '__main__':
    render(load_font('consola.ttf'), 'Hello World!', 'hello_world.png')
```

### Result
The results of running that script is the words "Hello World!" produced
upside down and rasterised by [Skia][7].
