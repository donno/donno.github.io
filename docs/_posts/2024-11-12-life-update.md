In short life has been really busy the past several months as a month ago
I got married. So in the lead-up for that there was working on the details of
that as well as planning the honey moon.

As a result, I haven't had much time to spare to working on other projects
or writing about them.

I'll keep this update brief and finish it off with a photo of the beautiful 
reception venue.
