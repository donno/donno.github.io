Today I felt compelled to look at putting Chess into a 3D program using its
Python library to create the geometry and leave it to the program to handle the
rendering. If it helps, kind of think of it as Blender.

I wasn't really interested in spending my time writing a library for dealing
with maintaining the board state or rules of Chess which is where the
[python-chess][1] ([Docs][2], [GitHub][3]) comes in. This package takes cares
of all of that plus has an additional feature that made this project easier.
It supports being able to connect to a chess engine like [Stockfish][4] using
the Universal Chess Interface (UCI). In practice what this meant was  instead
of having to spend time setting up input for being able to select pieces and
move them about and deal with two players as well as playing the game. I was
able to set-up it up to battle two computers against one another.


I started looking for 3D models to use for the pieces and I started with sites
for 3D printing pieces. However they never looked quite right and after
spending about an hour looking around, I came across a set on
[GrabCAD by Allan Morel][5]. These models were incredibly detailed and they
started me thinking that I didn't really want something as detailed as it means
the file size for the assets will be larger. I started trying to simplify down
the facet count but it never really looked right. I realised the keyword I
should have been using was low-poly and I came across some that looked nice but
at this point I had already prepared the first set ready for use and didn't
want to delay coding any longer.

With that sorted out, I was now ready to draw the board. That was fairly easy
as the library provides the position (known as the square index) of each piece
so iterating over it and translating the square index into a row and column and
then into the screen space did the trick.

So it turned out the pieces were only about 2 units high where the squares they
are sitting on are about 32 units across. That was rather a simple change as I
just needed to scale the pieces which could be done within the program's
graphics engine.

Now that I had the board done with the initial pieces I could see two problems.
The first problem is the knights are not symmetrical and thus the white knights
seem to be facing the wrong way. The bishops also aren't symmetrical but they
aren't as noticeable and I am really not bothered about that. If anything it is
somewhat nicer that they aren't looking at a mirror image of themselves. The
second problem is the black pieces look way too black mostly because the
graphics engine doesn't cast shadows onto them. They look like they are coated
in the darkest known substances that absorb about 99.97% of light.
As I mentioned, I won't worry about the first problem but the second is a
rather easy fix. I can simply change the colour from black (255, 255, 255) to
charcoal (54, 69, 79).

Next up was to re-draw the board state between moves. I wasn't interested in
implementing animation to show the pieces get picked up and moved along.
However this made me somewhat worried because the library didn't represent
pieces with unique identifiers on the board.
This means when you are looking at a board before and after a move is played
then you have no idea which pieces were moved. For example, you are told there
is a white knight in this square and a white knight in that square rather than
white knight 1 is here and white knight 2. This means technically what you
might see in my implementation is one knight jumps to the position of the other
knight and then that knight moves to the position of the first (or even its new
position). This would likely be a non issue when dealing with the animation
aspect because I would see the information that says the piece in this square
(which is a knight) is being moved to this other square.

However after watching the AI play around a bit I spotted a problem:

![Showing that capturing pieces is NYI](/assets/04_FoundNextFeatureToImplement.png "No capturing yet")

So onto the next problem was I hadn't implemented capturing. When one piece
moves into the same square as an opponent piece then that piece captures it.
At this point, all I had done is look at what pieces were on the board and
where and moved them around. I haven't accounted for it if the piece is no
longer on the board.I didn't end up looking to see if the library knows which
pieces have been taken.

This fell out as a consequence of how I implemented the code to find what
pieces to move. After moving all the pieces around on the board, I was left
with a list of of pieces that weren't found on the board. This list thus
contained the list of pieces no longer on the board. Now I had two choices
here, to delete the pieces once they are captured or move them into a capture
area along the side of the board.

Deleting the pieces here means to remove them from the game and graphics engine.
I wanted to do the latter option. I started doing that but there seemed to be
a problem so I switched to the delete method for this next screenshot.

![Kasparov vs Karpov in 1985](/assets/05_Kasparov_vs_Karpov_1985.png "Kasparov vs Karpov in 1985")

That is the board state of a game played by [Kasparov vs Karpov][6] in 1985.
This was easily replicated by copying the Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) for
the board state and setting the board to the state. This is a feature of
[python-chess][1]. FEN describes the board and what pieces are there.
Consecutive empty space is represented as a number so it is naturally
compressed. This is a rather nice feature as it meant I could get the board
into a certain feature which comes in handy later.

After seeing that work, I got back to fixing the capture zone. I was able to
get them to appear along the side like I wanted quite quickly.

![Captured pieces appearing along the side of the board](/assets/06_CapturedOnSide.png "Captured pieces appearing along the side of the board")

Yet as you see they take up a lot of space and look quite distracting. On the
space side, there are potentially 15 captured pieces.
But the board is only 8 pieces across if they are evenly spaced so it looks
like they are also overflowing. The simple solution here was to scale down the
captured pieces by 50%. The end result looks quite nice

![Smaller captured pieces](/assets/07_CapturedSmaller.png "X captured pieces appearing along the side of the board")

The next issue was noticed because of the side effect of shrinking the captured
pieces. When a pawn makes it to the end and gets promoted it would often become
a queen. But the problem here is it would be a small queen (or you might say
princess).

![Side effect of shrinking captured pieces](/assets/08_CaptureSideEffectPostPromotion.png "Side effect of shrinking captured pieces")

This one was an easy fix as it  required resetting the size of the pieces back
after promotion. The next problem I ran into was what would happened if there
was already a queen when a pawn is promoted.
Part of the problem was I assumed that a side would have 16 pieces and those
16 pieces would be the same type as they started as. So each side would have 8
pawns, 2 knights/rooks/bishops, a king and a queen. So if it looks for a
'queen' and can't find one so I needed to then convert one of the pawns into
the desired type.

Of course, when I was about to double check what happens when the two queen
problem occurs, the AI didn't do that. The next two games I watched the AI play
never got into a situation where they would end up with two queens. In the end,
I decided to cheat and use the FEN notation to put four pawns at the end of the
board. If I had known I was going to use the screenshot again I would have
tweaked the board. For example, castle the king and remove the defending forces
from in front of the pawns.

With that complete the last thing was to add support to saying game over. After
this one I also looked into adding information about who won or if it was a
draw why.
